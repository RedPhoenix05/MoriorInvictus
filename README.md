DESCRIPTION

Morior Invictus is a simple puzzle game. The focal game mechanic is death. But, with your backstock of souls, you die unvanquished.
In life, you are agile but vulnerable. A single slash from an enemy brings you down. However, this may be to your advantage. Deep in the forgotten labyrinths, it may be your only way to proceed.
